# I-ASD-ADP-23-24-Algorithms

The project structure is as follows:
There are two projects:
1. Algorithm
2. Algorithms.Tests

The Algorithms project has a folder for each algorithm or data structure that has been implemented. Each folder contains:
1. An interface for the algorithm or data structure
2. The implementation of the interface
3. A folder called 'Benchmarks' with a class that strives to benchmark the various operations

The Algorithms.Tests project has unit tests for ease of development via test driven development.
Each algorithm or data structure has one unit test at the top that proves that the provided datasets can be read by the algorithm or data structure.
